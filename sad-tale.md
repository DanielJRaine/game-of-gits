House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark takes the black.  He tells John Snow his own true identity.  Together, the two of them take control of the Night's watch, join forces with the wildlings and the Dragon Queen.  They agree to a compromise where Dragon momma gets the Iron Throne, and the Starks rule as wardens of the North.
